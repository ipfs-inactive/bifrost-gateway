## About

`bifrost-gateway` provides a single binary daemon implementation of [HTTP+Web Gateway Specs](https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/).

It is capable of serving requests to:
- [path gateway](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/address-ipfs-on-web/#path-gateway) at `127.0.0.1`
- [subdomain gateway](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/address-ipfs-on-web/#subdomain-gateway) requests with `Host: localhost`
- [DNSLink gateway](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/address-ipfs-on-web/#dnslink-gateway) based on `Host` header

Supported response types include both deserialized flat files, and [verifiable Block/CAR](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/http/gateway/#trustless-verifiable-retrieval).

For more information about IPFS Gateways, see:

- Specifications at [specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways](https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/)
- Conformance tests at [ipfs/gateway-conformance](https://github.com/ipfs/gateway-conformance)
- Go implementation at [boxo/gateway](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/tree/main/gateway)

## FAQ

### How to use other gateway as a block backend

All you need is a [trustless gateway](https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/trustless-gateway/) endpoint that supports [verifiable response types](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/http/gateway/#trustless-verifiable-retrieval).
The minimum requirement is support for `GET /ipfs/cid` with [application/vnd.ipld.raw](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.ipld.raw) (block by block).

To run against a compatible, local trustless gateway provided by [Kubo](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo) or [IPFS Desktop](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/):

```console
$ PROXY_GATEWAY_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8080" ./bifrost-gateway
```

See [_Proxy Backend_ in `./docs/environment-variables.md`](./docs/environment-variables.md#proxy-backend)

### How to run with Saturn CDN backend

[Saturn](https://saturn.tech) is a CDN that provides a pool of [trustless gateways](https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/trustless-gateway/).

`bifrost-gateway` supports it via the [Caboose](https://github.com/filecoin-saturn/caboose) backend,
which takes care of discovering and evaluating Block/CAR gateways (in Saturn called L1 nodes/peers) for increased availability.

See [_Saturn Backend_ in `./docs/environment-variables.md`](./docs/environment-variables.md#saturn-backend)

### How to debug

See [`GOLOG_LOG_LEVEL`](./docs/environment-variables.md#golog_log_level).

### How to use tracing

For tracing configuration, please check
[boxo/docs/tracing.md](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/blob/main/docs/tracing.md)
on how to generate the `traceparent` HTTP header in order to be able to easily
identify specific requests.


### How could this work for hosting a public IPFS gateway

This is WIP, but the high level architecture is to move from

**Old Kubo-based architecture:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A(((fa:fa-person HTTP</br>clients)))
    K[[Kubo]]
    N(((BGP Anycast,<br>HTTP load-balancers,<br>TLS termination)))

    D(((DHT)))

    P((( IPFS<br>Peers)))

    A -->| Accept: text/html, *| N
    A -->| Accept: application/vnd.ipld.raw | N
    A -->| Accept: application/vnd.ipld.car | N
    A -->| Accept: application/vnd.ipld.dag-json | N
    A -->| Accept: application/vnd.ipld.dag-cbor | N
    A -->| Accept: application/json | N
    A -->| Accept: application/cbor | N
    A -->| Accept: application/x-tar | N
    A -->| Accept: application/vnd.ipfs.ipns-record | N
    A -->| DNSLink Host: en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org | N
    A -->| Subdomain Host: cid.ipfs.dweb.link | N

    N ==>| fa:fa-link HTTP GET <br> Content Path | K

    K -.- D
    K ===|fa:fa-cube bitswapl | P
    P -.- D
```

**New Rhea architecture:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A(((fa:fa-person HTTP</br>clients)))
    B[[bifrost-gateway]]
    N(((BGP Anycast,<br>HTTP load-balancers,<br>TLS termination)))
    S(((Saturn<br>CDN)))
    I[[IPNI]]
    D(((DHT)))

    P((( IPFS<br>Peers)))

    A -->| Accept: text/html, *| N
    A -->| Accept: application/vnd.ipld.raw | N
    A -->| Accept: application/vnd.ipld.car | N
    A -->| Accept: application/vnd.ipld.dag-json | N
    A -->| Accept: application/vnd.ipld.dag-cbor | N
    A -->| Accept: application/json | N
    A -->| Accept: application/cbor | N
    A -->| Accept: application/x-tar | N
    A -->| Accept: application/vnd.ipfs.ipns-record | N
    A -->| DNSLink Host: en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org | N
    A -->| Subdomain Host: cid.ipfs.dweb.link | N

    N ==>| fa:fa-link HTTP GET <br> Content Path | B
    
    B ==>|fa:fa-cube HTTP GET <br> Blocks | S
    S -.- I 
    I -.- D 
    D -.- P -.- I
  
    P ===|fa:fa-cube the best block/dag <br> transfer protocol | S
```

`bifrost-gateway` nodes are responsible for processing requests to:

- [path gateway](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/address-ipfs-on-web/#path-gateway) (like `ipfs.io`)
- [subdomain gateway](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/address-ipfs-on-web/#subdomain-gateway) (like `dweb.link`)
- [selected DNSLink websites](https://github.com/protocol/bifrost-infra/blob/b6f85a54fddf1c21a966f8d5e5a3e31f54ad5431/ansible/inventories/bifrost/group_vars/collab_cluster.yml#L140-L271) on their own domain names.

Caveats:

- IPFS Gateway interface based on reference implementation from [boxo/gateway](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/tree/main/gateway#readme).
- IPFS Backend based on https://saturn.tech and HTTP client talking to it  via [caboose](https://github.com/filecoin-saturn/caboose) with `STRN_LOGGER_SECRET`.
  - Learn more at [Project Rhea (decentralized IPFS gateway)](https://pl-strflt.notion.site/Project-Rhea-decentralized-IPFS-gateway-3d5906e7a0d84bea800d5920005dfea6)
- Remaining functional gaps facilitated by:
  - (initially) temporary delegation to legacy Kubo RPC (`/api/v0`) at `https://node[0-3].delegate.ipfs.io` infra (legacy nodes used by js-ipfs, in process of deprecation).
  - (long-term) `IPNS_RECORD_GATEWAY_URL` endpoint capable of resolving `GET /ipns/{name}` with `Accept: application/vnd.ipfs.ipns-record`
